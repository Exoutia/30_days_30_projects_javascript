# 30 Days 30 project challenge 
For a while now I want to learn some frontend development, but I have never been able to learn it beyond basic that's why I am challenging myself for these 30 days starting today.

I will create 30 projects everyday one project it will not be very big and will follow `Done Principle` according to which everything i do needs to be done according to my standard even failing refer as done. Just doing and complete the process would be fine for me.
